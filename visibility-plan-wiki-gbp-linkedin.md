# Baaz Visibility Plan: Wikipedia/Wikidata, Google Business Profile & LinkedIn

---

## Current State Assessment

| Platform | Baaz Status | Competitor Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| **Wikipedia** | No article exists | Thoughtworks, Freshworks, Postman all have detailed Wikipedia pages with revenue, founding story, key personnel, acquisitions, products |
| **Wikidata** | No entity exists | All major software companies have structured Wikidata entities that feed into Google Knowledge Panels and AI Overviews |
| **Google Business Profile** | Basic JustDial listing exists; no verified GBP found | Simform, Thoughtworks have complete GBP profiles with services, photos, reviews, and posts |
| **LinkedIn Company Page** | Unclear/minimal presence | ValueCoders gained 40% more social traffic; A3Logics gained 13,000+ organic followers in one year through value-led content |

---

## Part 1: Wikidata Entity (Month 1 — Week 1-2)

### Why Wikidata First (Not Wikipedia)

Wikipedia requires strict notability criteria (multiple independent reliable sources covering the company in depth). Baaz likely does not meet Wikipedia's General Notability Guideline yet. However, **Wikidata has much lower barriers** — any business with verifiable information from independent sources qualifies. And critically, **Google's Knowledge Graph and AI Overviews pull directly from Wikidata**, making this the highest-ROI first step.

### Step-by-Step: Create the Baaz Wikidata Entity

1. **Go to** https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem
2. **Label:** `Baaz` (en)
3. **Description:** `Indian product engineering and software development agency` (en)
4. **Aliases:** `Baaz.pro`, `Baaz HQ`, `atiiad Technologies Private Limited`

### Properties to Add

| Property | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Instance of (P31)** | business (Q4830453) | Core type |
| **Inception (P571)** | 2018 | Founding year |
| **Country (P17)** | India (Q668) | |
| **Headquarters location (P159)** | Bangalore (Q1355) | Use qualifier: Binnamangala |
| **Industry (P452)** | software industry (Q638608) | |
| **Industry (P452)** | information technology consulting (Q1378185) | Add second value |
| **Official website (P856)** | https://www.baaz.pro | |
| **Legal name** | atiiad Technologies Private Limited | From IndiaMART listing |
| **Number of employees (P1128)** | <50 | Use "less than 50" qualifier |
| **Product or material produced (P1056)** | software (Q7397), mobile app (Q620615) | |
| **Founder (P112)** | Chitresh Parihar | Create a separate Wikidata item for the founder if none exists |
| **Described by source** | link to Clutch profile, GoodFirms listing, IndiaMART listing | These serve as independent references |

### Sources to Cite (Critical — Every Claim Needs a Reference)

You need **independent, verifiable sources**. Use these:

1. **Clutch.co profile** — already created (provides founding year, location, services, reviews)
2. **GoodFirms profile** — already created
3. **IndiaMART listing** — shows legal name "atiiad Technologies Private Limited"
4. **JustDial listing** — confirms Bangalore location
5. **DesignRush profile** — if live
6. **MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs)** — search for company registration at https://www.mca.gov.in/mcafoportal/showCheckCompanyName.do to get incorporation date, registered address, directors

### What You Cannot Add (Yet)

- Revenue figures (need audited/published source)
- Wikipedia sitelink (no article exists)
- Awards (need press coverage as source)

### Building Toward Wikipedia (Long-Term, Month 6+)

To eventually qualify for a Wikipedia article, Baaz needs:
- **3+ independent press articles** covering the company (not paid/sponsored)
- Coverage in outlets like YourStory, Inc42, Economic Times Tech, TechCrunch India
- **Strategy:** Publish the guest articles you're already writing (legacy modernization, AI PoC to production), pitch to outlets, get covered

### Step 4: Photos (Upload 20+ — Critical for Visibility)

Businesses with photos get **45% more direction requests and 31% more website clicks**. Google's Vision AI now reads images to categorize your services.

| Photo Type | What to Upload | Qty |
|---|---|---|
| **Logo** | Baaz logo (from `public/assets/Logo.svg`, export as PNG) | 1 |
| **Cover** | Office exterior or a branded banner showing "Baaz — Product Engineering Agency" | 1 |
| **Interior** | Office workspace, meeting rooms, whiteboards with product designs | 3-4 |
| **Team** | Team photos, working sessions, sprint demos, standups | 3-4 |
| **At work** | Screens showing products you've built (blur sensitive data), design reviews, code reviews | 3-4 |
| **Product screenshots** | Screenshots from case studies (work1, work2), dashboards, mobile apps | 4-5 |
| **Events** | Team at tech meetups, conferences, hackathons | 2-3 |
| **Client logos** | A collage or individual images of client brands (Uber, Decathlon, etc.) — check usage permissions | 1-2 |

### Step 5: Posts (Weekly — Ongoing)

Post types to rotate weekly:

| Week | Post Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Update** | "We just shipped a real-time visual inspection platform powered by computer vision for a manufacturing client. [Link to case study]" |
| 2 | **Update** | "How we reduced time-to-hire by 60% by automating tech assessments with AI. Read the case study →" |
| 3 | **Update** | Blog post share: "Legacy Modernization: When to Rebuild vs. Re-Platform [link to blog]" |
| 4 | **Offer** | "Book a free product strategy session — we'll map your MVP in 60 minutes. [Link to /get-in-touch]" |
| 5 | **Update** | "AI in production: Why 85% of AI PoCs never make it — and how to beat the odds [link to blog]" |
| 6 | **Event** | "Join us at [local tech event] — Chitresh Parihar on building products that scale" |

### Step 6: Q&A Section (Pre-Seed Questions)

Google retired the public Q&A feature in late 2025 and is replacing it with AI-powered "Ask Maps" (Gemini). However, **FAQ schema on your website feeds directly into this**. You already have FAQ schema on the enterprise page — extend this to all service pages. The AI will pull from your structured data.

### Step 7: Reviews (Most Important Signal)

- **Target:** 10+ reviews in the first 60 days
- **Ask:** Past clients (Uber team, Decathlon team, Livpure team, Nalli team, etc.)
- **How:** Send a direct Google review link (generate from your GBP dashboard)
- **Respond:** Reply to every review within 24 hours — Google uses response speed as a trust signal
- **Keywords in responses:** Naturally include terms like "product engineering," "AI development," "mobile app," "Bangalore" in your replies

**COMPANY — MONDAY (Industry Insight)**

A factory in Chennai was producing 847,000 electronic components per day.

Their defect detection rate? 76.8%.
Customer returns? 12.3%.
Annual cost of returns and warranty claims? $2.8 million.
47 quality inspectors working in shifts. 156 hours per week of manual visual inspection.

And still — 23% of defects were getting missed. Human eyes get tired.

We built Viz Pro, an AI-powered visual inspection system using computer vision.

The results after deployment:
→ Detection rate: 76.8% → 99.7%
→ Inspection speed: 14x faster (3.2 sec → 0.23 sec per component)
→ Customer returns: down 94%
→ Annual savings: $4.2M
→ ROI: 278% in year one

The model didn't replace the inspectors. It replaced the fatigue. 47 people moved to higher-value roles.

That's what production AI looks like — not a demo, not a dashboard. A system running 24/7 on a factory floor, catching defects the human eye literally cannot see.

**COMPANY — TUESDAY (Case Study / Build Story)**

A SaaS company in San Francisco was drowning in resumes.

847 applications for a single senior backend engineer position.
23 hours per week spent on manual screening.
34% of qualified candidates missed due to screening fatigue.
$47,000 average cost per hire. 89 days to fill a role.

We built Suprflow — an AI-powered hiring automation platform.

What changed:
→ Screening time: 156 hrs/month → 23 hrs/month (85% reduction)
→ Cost per hire: $47,000 → $18,500 (61% decrease)
→ Time to hire: 89 days → 31 days
→ 90-day retention rate: 71% → 94%
→ 43% increase in diverse candidate shortlisting
→ Annual savings: $847,000 across 34 hires
→ ROI: 340% in the first year

The unexpected win? Bias reduction. The AI's blind evaluation process eliminated "gut feeling" decisions that masked unconscious bias. 67% more candidates from non-traditional backgrounds made it to final rounds.

Better hires. Faster. Cheaper. More diverse. That's what happens when you treat hiring as a product engineering problem, not a process problem.

**COMPANY — THURSDAY (Technical Deep Dive)**

85% of AI projects never make it to production. (Gartner)
87% of data science projects die in the PoC phase. (VentureBeat)

We've shipped AI products that process 50M+ transactions daily for fraud detection, run computer vision on factory floors, and support clinical decision-making across 200+ hospitals.

Here's the pattern we see in the 15% that actually ship:

1. They scope brutally. One workflow. One metric. One user type. Not "add AI to our platform."

2. They spend 60-80% of time on data engineering, not model tuning. Pipelines, quality checks, labeling, versioning — this is where projects live or die.

3. They start with the simplest model that could work. A gradient-boosted tree you can deploy in a week beats a transformer that takes three months to train and serve.

4. They keep humans in the loop at launch. AI recommends, human decides. Remove the human only when the model has earned trust.

5. They own monitoring from day one. Infrastructure metrics, model metrics, and business metrics — all three, continuously.

The model is the easy part. The product engineering around it is the hard part.

If you're stuck between PoC and production, this is almost always where the gap lives.

**CHITRESH — MONDAY (Founder Perspective / Business Insight)**

Everyone asks: "How much does it cost to build enterprise software?"

The honest answer after 100+ builds since 2018:

The price of the software is never the real cost. The real cost is the cost of building the wrong thing.

We had an enterprise client last year who came to us after spending $600K with another agency. They had a "finished" product. It had every feature on the spec sheet.

Usage after 3 months? 11% of the features were being used. The remaining 89% were spec-driven, not user-driven.

We ran a 3-week discovery. Rebuilt the core workflows. Shipped in 10 weeks. Adoption went from 23% to 81%.

The second build cost less than a third of the first. Because we built what people actually needed, not what a committee imagined they might.

If you're about to greenlight a $500K build, spend $30K on discovery first. It's the cheapest insurance in enterprise software.

**CHITRESH — TUESDAY (Industry Take / Contrarian)**

Unpopular opinion: Most companies don't need AI. They need better software.

I talk to 10-15 prospective clients a month. At least half say "we want to add AI." When I ask what problem they're solving, the answer is usually vague.

Here's the test I use:

Can a well-designed rule-based system solve this? → Build that first.
Do you have clean, labeled data? → If no, you're not ready for AI.
Will a human trust this system enough to act on it? → If no, the AI doesn't matter.

The projects where AI actually moved the needle for our clients had something in common: the problem was clearly defined before anyone mentioned a model.

A manufacturing client losing $2.8M/year to defects? That's an AI problem — and we built a system that saves them $4.2M/year.

A company that wants "an AI dashboard"? That's a strategy problem, not a technology problem.

Don't start with AI. Start with the problem. The right solution might be AI. It might be a better workflow. It might be firing up Excel.

**CHITRESH — WEDNESDAY (Client Win / Story)**

A hiring team was spending $47,000 per hire and taking 89 days to fill a single engineering role.

847 applications per position. 23 hours per week manually screening resumes.

And the worst part? They were missing 34% of qualified candidates because of screening fatigue.

We didn't build them "an AI tool." We built them a hiring product.

Suprflow automates resume screening, runs blind technical assessments, and gives every candidate automated feedback within 24 hours.

Results after 6 months:
- Cost per hire: $47K → $18.5K
- Time to hire: 89 days → 31 days
- Candidate satisfaction: 61% → 92%
- Diverse candidate shortlisting: up 43%

The CFO noticed. The candidates noticed. The hiring managers went from 6.2/10 satisfaction to 9.1/10.

What I learned: the best products don't just save money. They make people's work life measurably better.

If your hiring process feels broken, it probably is. And the fix isn't more recruiters — it's better product thinking applied to recruitment.

**CHITRESH — FRIDAY (Framework / Lessons)**

After 100+ products built since 2018, here's the framework I use to decide whether a client project will succeed or fail — before we write a single line of code.

I call it the 3-Owner Test:

1. Is there a Problem Owner? Someone who can describe the pain in dollars, hours, or user drop-off — not in features.

2. Is there a Decision Owner? One person who can say yes or no without a 6-week committee review.

3. Is there a User Owner? Someone who represents the actual end user and will test, give feedback, and push back on what doesn't work.

If a project has all three, it ships. If it's missing even one, it stalls.

The biggest enterprise project we ever saw fail had a $1.2M budget, 14 stakeholders, and zero clarity on who the actual user was.

The most successful one had a $150K budget, one product owner, and weekly user testing from day one.

Budget doesn't predict success. Ownership does.

Save this. Use it in your next kickoff.

#### Ruben (CTO, Technical): This Week's Posts

**RUBEN — MONDAY (Architecture Decision / Deep Dive)**

We built a computer vision system that inspects 847,000 electronic components per day on a factory floor.

The hardest part wasn't the model. It was the latency constraint.

The old process: 3.2 seconds per component, human inspection.
Our target: sub-1 second, automated.
What we shipped: 0.23 seconds per component. 14x faster.

Here's what we had to get right architecturally:

→ Edge inference, not cloud. You can't send 847K images to a cloud API per day and meet sub-second latency. We deployed the model directly on edge devices at the inspection stations.

→ Lightweight model architecture. We started with a ResNet variant and distilled it down. The production model is 12x smaller than our best-accuracy model — and only 0.3% less accurate. That 0.3% trade-off bought us the latency budget.

→ Continuous data pipeline. The factory produces new defect patterns over time (new suppliers, new component batches). We built an automated pipeline: capture → label → retrain → validate → deploy. The model improves every week without manual intervention.

→ Fallback logic. If the model's confidence is below threshold, the component routes to a human inspector. Not every edge case needs to be solved by AI. Sometimes the right answer is "flag it."

Result: 99.7% detection rate. 0.3% false positive rate. $4.2M in annual savings.

The lesson: production AI is an engineering problem, not a data science problem. The model is 20% of the work. The infrastructure around it is the other 80%.

**RUBEN — TUESDAY (Technical Opinion / Contrarian)**

Hot take: "Let's just rewrite it" is the most expensive sentence in enterprise software.

I've seen it three times this year alone. A company with a legacy system that works but is painful. Someone says "let's rebuild from scratch." Six months and $400K later, they have half the features and twice the bugs.

The data backs this up: Standish Group says large IT rewrites have a 60%+ failure rate. McKinsey found they run 66% over budget.

Why? Because a rewrite isn't replacing code. It's replacing years of institutional knowledge, undocumented edge cases, and integrations nobody fully understands.

What we do instead: the Strangler Fig pattern.

1. Map every bounded context in the legacy system (2-4 weeks)
2. Pick the highest-pain, cleanest-boundary context first
3. Build it as a standalone service with an anti-corruption layer to the old system
4. Validate with real production data
5. Cut over. The old module becomes the fallback.
6. Repeat for the next context. Each cycle gets faster.

One manufacturing client saved $15M annually by phasing their supply chain modernization this way — replacing legacy batch processing with predictive analytics, one module at a time. No big bang. No parallel systems burning budget.

If someone on your team is pitching a rewrite, ask them:
- Is the system < 10K lines of code? → Rewrite might work.
- Can the business freeze features for 6 months? → If no, don't rewrite.
- Does complete documentation exist? → If no, you'll rediscover every edge case the hard way.

Most enterprise systems fail all three tests. Phase it.

**RUBEN — WEDNESDAY (Behind-the-Build / Technical Story)**

We built an AI-powered hiring platform that reduced cost-per-hire from $47,000 to $18,500.

Here's the technical architecture that made it work:

**Resume Parsing Layer**
The system handles 156 different resume formats (PDF, DOCX, images, even one submitted as a haiku). We built a multi-format extraction pipeline using a combination of OCR, structural parsing, and an LLM-based normalization step that converts any format into a structured candidate profile.

**Blind Assessment Engine**
This was the key design decision. The AI evaluates candidates without seeing names, photos, universities, or previous employers. Just skills, experience patterns, and assessment responses. This is what drove the 43% increase in diverse candidate shortlisting — not a diversity filter, but the removal of bias vectors.

**Scoring & Ranking**
Not a single score. A multi-dimensional skill map that matches against role requirements. Hiring managers see where candidates are strong and where there are gaps — not just "87% match." This transparency is what drove hiring manager satisfaction from 6.2/10 to 9.1/10.

**Feedback Loop**
Every hiring decision (accept, reject, 90-day performance review) feeds back into the model. The system gets better with every hire. 90-day retention went from 71% to 94% — partly because the model learned what "succeeds in this role at this company" actually looks like, not just what looks good on paper.

The real insight: AI hiring tools fail when they try to replace human judgment. They succeed when they remove the noise so humans can make better judgments faster.

**RUBEN — FRIDAY (Engineering Culture / Practical Advice)**

The question I get asked most by technical founders: "Should we build in-house or hire an agency?"

After being on both sides — running engineering teams and now running the CTO side of an agency that's shipped 100+ products — here's my honest framework:

**Build in-house when:**
- You have product-market fit and a 12+ month roadmap
- Your core IP is the software itself
- You can hire and retain senior engineers (this takes 3-6 months minimum)

**Use an agency when:**
- You need to ship an MVP in 8-12 weeks
- You need burst capacity for a specific initiative
- You lack specific skills (AI/ML, mobile, cloud architecture) and can't wait 6 months to hire
- You want to de-risk a new product before committing to permanent headcount

**The hybrid that actually works:**
Agency builds v1. You hire 1-2 engineers who work alongside the agency team. Knowledge transfer happens organically. By the time v1 ships, your in-house team understands the codebase and can take over maintenance and iteration.

We've done this transition with multiple clients. The key: your agency should be writing code that your future in-house team can maintain. No clever abstractions that require agency-specific knowledge. Clean architecture. Good docs. Standard tooling.

If your agency builds something only they can maintain, they're not a partner. They're a dependency.

**Post 3 — Thought Leadership:**
> 85% of enterprise AI projects never make it to production. The gap isn't the model — it's the engineering. Infrastructure, data pipelines, monitoring, and team readiness matter more than algorithm choice.

### GBP — 20 Review Templates (Share with Customers)

*Send these to clients so they can pick one, copy-paste, or tweak. Each is written to sound human and includes relevant keywords (product engineering, custom software, mobile app, AI, Bangalore, etc.) for SEO/local (GEO). Customers can leave as-is or personalize.*

1. **Short, general**
   > Hired Baaz for our mobile app. Clear communication, on-time delivery. Solid product engineering team in Bangalore. Would work with them again.

2. **Software / product engineering**
   > We needed a custom software solution for our operations. Baaz understood the requirements quickly and delivered something we could actually scale. Professional and responsive. One of the better software development agencies we’ve worked with in Bangalore.

3. **Mobile app**
   > Baaz built our cross-platform mobile app from scratch. They handled everything from UI/UX to deployment. The app is live and our users love it. Recommend for anyone looking for serious mobile app development in India.

4. **AI / discovery**
   > We came with a vague “we want AI” brief. Baaz ran a short discovery, narrowed the scope, and built something that actually went to production. No fluff — real product engineering. Happy with the outcome.

5. **Enterprise / timeline**
   > Engaged Baaz for an enterprise dashboard and integration work. They met deadlines and the code quality was good. Communication was clear throughout. Good choice for custom software development in Bangalore.

6. **Design + build**
   > We needed both design and development. Baaz did the UI/UX first, then built it. No handoff drama — same team from strategy to launch. That’s rare. Would recommend for product strategy and development.

7. **Startup / MVP**
   > As a startup we needed to move fast. Baaz helped us scope our MVP and shipped the first version in a few months. They get startups. Good partner for product engineering if you’re based in India or working with Indian teams.

8. **Ongoing relationship**
   > We’ve done two projects with Baaz — first a web app, then a mobile app. Consistent quality and they remember our context. Feels like a long-term partner, not a one-off vendor. Recommended for custom software and mobile.

9. **Technical / architecture**
   > Our project had legacy systems and new requirements. Baaz proposed a phased approach instead of a big-bang rewrite. We’re live on the first phase and it’s stable. Sensible software development and architecture.

10. **Communication / remote**
    > We’re in the US, Baaz is in Bangalore. Time zones could have been an issue but they were flexible with calls and updates. Delivered our SaaS product on time. Good experience with a remote product engineering team.

11. **Design focus**
    > The UI/UX work stood out. They didn’t just make it look good — they improved flows and reduced clicks. Our conversion improved after the redesign. Strong design and development combo in Bangalore.

12. **AI / production**
    > We had an AI PoC that never made it to production. Baaz took it over — data pipelines, deployment, monitoring. Now it runs in production and we’re scaling it. If you need AI that actually ships, talk to them.

13. **Scope and budget**
    > We had a fixed budget. Baaz helped us prioritise features and delivered a working product within it. No surprise scope creep. Transparent and professional. Good for startups and mid-size product builds.

14. **Post-launch support**
    > The app launched on time. What we didn’t expect was how helpful they were after launch — bug fixes, small tweaks, and solid documentation. We still reach out when we need product engineering support.

15. **Bangalore / local**
    > We were looking for a product engineering agency in Bangalore. Found Baaz through a referral. They delivered our custom software project on schedule. Would recommend to anyone looking for software development in Bangalore.

16. **Enterprise / compliance**
    > We needed enterprise-grade software with proper access control and audit trails. Baaz got the requirements and built it. Code quality and documentation were up to standard. Good for enterprise software development.

17. **Speed and quality**
    > Needed to get to market quickly without cutting corners. Baaz balanced speed and quality — we had a usable MVP in weeks and then iterated. Good fit if you need custom software development that can move fast.

18. **Discovery first**
    > We almost built the wrong thing. Baaz insisted on a short discovery phase. They were right — we changed scope and saved time and money. Their product strategy and discovery process are worth it.

19. **Flutter / cross-platform**
    > We chose Flutter and wanted a team that knew it. Baaz built our app in Flutter for iOS and Android. Single codebase, consistent experience. Recommend for mobile app development, especially cross-platform.

20. **End-to-end**
    > From idea to live product — strategy, design, development, and deployment. Baaz handled it all. We’re a non-tech company and they made the process clear. One of the best product engineering experiences we’ve had. Based in Bangalore, work with clients globally.
