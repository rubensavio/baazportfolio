    intro:

The best alternatives match that on delivery and craft, but often with a leaner structure: smaller teams, direct access to senior engineers, and a focus on shipping rather than long-running engagements.",
          "Look for agencies that do discovery and strategy as part of the build, not as a separate phase. You want a product engineering partner that can go from idea to MVP and then scale—without handing you off to another team.",

      "Startups need agencies that move fast, think in product terms, and don't hide behind process. There's no single 'best' list—it depends on your stage, stack, and culture. Here's what actually matters when you're picking a software development agency for your startup.",
