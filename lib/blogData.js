Boutique firms excel at speed, senior attention, and product-oriented delivery. If you need to ship a product quickly with a team that stays close to the work, a boutique firm is usually the better fit.

        answer:

For building a product from scratch, an agency provides the breadth of skills and coordination needed. For specific features or fixes, a freelancer can be more cost-effective.",

        answer:
          "A typical MVP takes 8–16 weeks with a product engineering agency. The timeline includes 1–2 weeks of discovery, 2–3 weeks of design, and 5–10 weeks of development. The key is defining a tight scope — the most successful MVPs focus on one core workflow for one user type, then expand based on real user feedback.",

        answer:
          "Most early-stage startups (pre-seed to Series A) benefit from outsourcing — it's faster, provides access to senior talent, and avoids the overhead of hiring a full team. In-house makes sense once you have product-market fit and a long roadmap that justifies permanent headcount. Many startups use a hybrid: agency for the initial build, then gradually build an in-house team.",

        question: "How long does enterprise product engineering take?",
        answer:
          "An enterprise product engineering project typically takes 4–12 months from discovery to launch. Discovery takes 2–4 weeks, design 3–6 weeks, and development 3–9 months depending on scope. The first usable release is usually within 10–14 weeks. Ongoing iteration and support continue after launch.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much does enterprise product engineering cost?",
        answer:
          "Enterprise product engineering costs $150,000–$1M+ depending on scope. A focused product (internal tool, customer portal) runs $150,000–$400,000. A platform with multiple user types, integrations, and compliance requirements can cost $400,000–$1M+. Phased delivery reduces risk — you invest in the highest-value features first and expand based on real usage data.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between product engineering and software development?",
        answer:
          "Software development focuses on writing code to meet specifications. Product engineering encompasses the full product lifecycle — strategy, user research, design, development, QA, deployment, and iteration. A product engineering agency like Baaz doesn't just build what you ask for; we help define what to build, validate it with users, and optimise for business outcomes.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do enterprises manage risk in product engineering projects?",
        answer:
          "Key risk management practices include: phased delivery (build the riskiest/highest-value features first), continuous QA (catch issues early, not at the end), regular stakeholder demos (align expectations every 2 weeks), security-by-design (compliance built into architecture, not bolted on), and staged rollouts (pilot with a small group before broad launch). At Baaz, we bake these practices into every enterprise engagement.",
