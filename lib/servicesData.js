Product management focuses on the 'how' and 'when' — day-to-day execution, backlog prioritisation, and shipping features. Strategy sets the destination; management drives the journey. Many companies use a product strategy consultant to set the foundation, then hand off to a product manager for ongoing execution.",

        answer:
          "Companies typically hire product strategy consultants when launching a new digital product, pivoting an existing one, entering a new market, or when internal teams lack the bandwidth or expertise for strategic planning. It's especially valuable before committing significant development budget — a well-defined strategy can save 30–50% on development costs by avoiding misaligned features.",

UI (User Interface) design focuses on how it looks — colours, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

Good UX reduces customer support costs by up to 15%, increases conversion rates by 200–400%, and improves customer retention.

        question: "What technologies do custom software development agencies use?",
        answer:
          "Modern agencies use React, Next.js, Vue, or Angular for frontend; Node.js, Python (Django/FastAPI), or Laravel for backend; PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis for databases; and AWS, GCP, or Azure for cloud infrastructure. The right stack depends on your product's requirements for performance, scale, and team expertise.",

Cross-platform development uses a single codebase (Flutter or React Native) to deploy on both platforms, reducing cost and time by 30–40%.
