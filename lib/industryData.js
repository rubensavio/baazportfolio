A full project management platform with resource planning, procurement, and reporting costs $150,000–$300,000. Custom software pays for itself when it reduces rework (which accounts for 30% of construction costs industry-wide).",

      {
        question: "Why do construction companies need custom software?",
        answer:
          "Off-the-shelf tools often don't fit construction workflows — they're too generic, don't work offline on remote sites, or can't integrate with existing ERP and accounting systems. Custom software matches your exact processes, reduces double entry, and provides real-time visibility across projects, sites, and teams. McKinsey reports that large construction projects typically run 80% over budget — better software directly addresses this.",

      {
        question: "Can construction apps work offline on job sites?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We build mobile apps with offline-first architecture — data is stored locally on the device and syncs automatically when connectivity is restored. This is essential for construction where many job sites have limited or no internet. Offline support covers forms, photos, inspections, timesheets, and task updates.",

          "A focused tool (e.g., field reporting or daily logs) takes 8–12 weeks. A comprehensive project management platform takes 4–8 months. We recommend starting with the highest-pain workflow, proving value with real users, then expanding. This approach accelerates adoption and reduces risk.",
